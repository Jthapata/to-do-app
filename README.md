# to-do-app

This is a simple to do app that allows users to make lists with tasks in them. Users can also edit and delete tasks, and they can delete lists. I used vanilla JavaScript and localStorage for the funcionality and storage of lists and tasks. I used TailwindCSS and vanilla CSS for the design of the page.
