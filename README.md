# to-do-app

This is a simple to do app that allows users to make lists with tasks in them. Users can also edit and delete tasks, and they can delete lists. Users are also able check tasks as completed. I used vanilla JavaScript and localStorage for the funcionality and storage of lists and tasks. I used TailwindCSS and vanilla CSS for the design of the page.
